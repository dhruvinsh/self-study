# Description
Collection of some self-study notes.

Current focus is `Big-O` and basic algorithms.

Along with above try to solve some "Leetcode" interview questions.

## Note
Currently using Neovim's [neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg) mode to take all the notes. Shortly with stable release it should have some markdown export option, hence this repo will update with markdown docs.
